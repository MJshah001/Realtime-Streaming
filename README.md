# Realtime Data Streaming With TCP Socket, Apache Spark, OpenAI LLM, Kafka and Elasticsearch | Analyzing Customer Sentiment 

## 🌟 Project Overview  
In today’s fast-paced digital world, real-time sentiment analysis has become a critical tool for understanding public opinion, whether it’s gauging reactions during live events or responding to customer feedback on e-commerce platforms. This project builds an end-to-end, scalable pipeline to process millions of customer reviews in real-time using advanced technologies such as Spark, Kafka, and OpenAI LLM. The project delivers actionable insights from large-scale textual data in sub-second time, with results visualized through Elasticsearch and Kibana.

## 🚀 Key Features  
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Ingests and processes over 7 million customer reviews using Kafka and Spark Streaming.
- **Sentiment Analysis with OpenAI**: Analyzes customer sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) in real-time using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo.
- **High-Performance Data Retrieval**: Fast data querying and retrieval using Elasticsearch, supporting over 1,000 sentiment queries per second.
- **Scalable and Fault-Tolerant**: Designed with Docker for seamless scaling, ensuring 99.9% uptime for distributed services.

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **Apache Spark**: For distributed real-time data processing and transformation.
- **Apache Kafka**: To manage and buffer real-time data streams efficiently.
- **OpenAI LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo)**: For advanced sentiment analysis on large textual datasets.
- **Elasticsearch & Kibana**: For storing, indexing, and visualizing sentiment analysis results.
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For containerizing and orchestrating services.
- **Python**: To glue the services and develop Spark Streaming and API integration logic.

1. **Data Ingestion**: Real-time customer reviews are streamed through TCP sockets.
2. **Data Buffering**: Kafka handles the message queues to ensure a smooth flow of real-time data.
3. **Data Processing**: Spark Streaming processes the incoming data, sending chunks of text to OpenAI for sentiment analysis.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo classifies each review into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
5. **Data Storage & Querying**: Processed data is sent to Elasticsearch for fast indexing and querying, which is visualized using Kibana.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.
- [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/) account for Kafka (or local Kafka setup).
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) for sentiment analysis.
- [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/) account for Elasticsearch (or local Elasticsearch setup).


### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MJshah001/Realtime-Streaming.git
   cd Realtime-Streaming
   cd src
   ```

2. **Setup Docker Containers**  
   Run the following command to start up all services, including Spark, Kafka, and Elasticsearch:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

3. **Configure API Keys**  
   - Add your OpenAI API key in `config.py`.
   - Set up your Kafka and Elasticsearch credentials in the respective sections of the configuration file.

4. **Start Streaming Data**  
   Execute the `streaming-socket.py` script to simulate real-time data streaming:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it spark-master python3 /opt/bitnami/spark/jobs/streaming-socket.py
   ```

5. **Run Spark Streaming Job**  
   Submit the PySpark job for real-time processing:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it spark-master /opt/bitnami/spark/bin/spark-submit  --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.5.2  --master spark://spark-master:7077  /opt/bitnami/spark/jobs/spark-streaming.py
   ```

6. **Monitor Data and Sentiment Trends**  
   USe Kibana to visualize and query real-time sentiment data indexed in Elasticsearch.  

<!--
